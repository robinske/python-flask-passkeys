# TODO

- [ ] Improve table display/layout styling
- [ ] Register/login on same page?
- [ ] Launch with ngrok. Tried with the ngrok package but it doesn't seem to kill the session reliably on close.
- [x] Factor out code in login.js and register.js
- [x] Better display newly created factors/challenges for feedback to demo user
- [x] Make persistent top nav instead of links on home page
- [x] Display flash messages from client side
- [x] Try to import ponyfill from jsdelivr instead of adding file
- [x] Load webauthn.js so you can use the `create` and `get` functions from the browser console.
- [x] Build challenge flow
